>Greetings, I have completed the task but due to time crunch I was not able to implement it in OO design. I really regret submitting without making appropriate changes but I am submitting my with proper backend working logic.  :slightly_frowning_face: :upside_down_face:

# Login behind my task. :computer:
* I programmed each user file in the data directory to be converted into csv so that I can implement pandas module.
* After conversion I assinged all the files to be concatinated to a single csv file.
* Then using sort function which comes in hand with pandas I used to it sort the dataframe.
* Afterwards, I exported each file back into their native format.
* `/result/user.extension/` directory is the final result delivered.
> Again, apologies for submitting a messed up file. I would be able to clean it up in a jiffy but I did not wanted to cross the time limit. Thanking you in advance.
